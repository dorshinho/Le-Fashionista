        <p> <strong><em>Le Fashionista</em></strong> is world-renowned for its impeccable Italian craftsmanship and its unique blend of luxury heritage and fashion authority. Established in Florence in 1921, its iconic Made In Italy style has become synonymous with elegance, sophistication and desirability.</p>
        <p> Being made in Italy is an integral part of the essence of <em>Le Fashionista</em> and goes beyond being a mere slogan. It is a cultural approach, a know-how that took generations to build, and a genuine mission that has allowed Le Fashionista to become one of the worlds most authentic luxury fashion brands.</p>
        <p> Even today <em>Le Fashionista</em> remains very much linked to Italys Tuscan region as it did ninety years ago when Giovedi Baggio Diadora first created his first leather bag. Since the opening of its original workshop in Florence on Via delle Caldaie, and throughout its expansion in the Seventies and Eighties into new headquarters at Casellina, outside of Florence, the House continues to grow its strong relationship with its home territory.</p>
